## **How to Play**

Your objective is to **ascend to the top** of the levels and hang the kingdom's flag. Be prepared for a challenge as every mistake could send you plummeting back down!

- Avoid hazards, collect coins, and carefully time your jumps to progress through the levels.
- Once at the top, raise the flag to record your final time. You can replay the game to try and beat your best time.

---

## **Game Modes**

- **Single Player**: Take on the challenge of climbing to the top by yourself.
- **Developer Mode**: Toggle developer mode to move freely and explore/debug levels. (Use `U` to enable/disable.)

---

## **Progress Saving**

The game automatically saves your:
- Current level, position, and time when exiting.
- Coins collected and whether skins are unlocked.
- Best completion time.

Saved progress is stored in `progress.json` and `savegame.json` files. You can delete these files manually to reset your progress.
